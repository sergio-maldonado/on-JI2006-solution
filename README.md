This repository supplements the paper:
Maldonado and Uchasara (2019). On the thermodynamics-based equilibrium beach profile derived by Jenkins and Inman (2006). arXiv: XXXXX

NOTES:
+The folder 'JI2006_digitised_solutions_fig8' contains the digitised shorerise profiles (field measurements) shown in fig. 8 of Jenkins and Inman (2006).

+The Matlab code 'value_functional.m' estimates the functional (eq. 2 in Maldonado and Uchasara 2019) numerically for any given curve h(x). Note that J[h(x)] is computed instead of J[x(h)], with necessary modifications having been made to ensure equivalence. 

+The file 'functionals_comparison.xlsx' summarises the values (in arbitrary units) of the functionals yielded by each curve, including Jenkins and Inman's solution. This feeds into table 2 of Maldonado and Uchasara (2019).
